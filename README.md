# date-service

A simple example of a Viam module. It prints the date and time every second.

[Add the module](https://docs.viam.com/extend/modular-resources/configure/) to get started.

Note: this example would be better served as a process since it does not actually conform to a module nor does it provide a service model. Nevertheless, it is a good example to validate module deployment to a robot.
